Goal: make a web-based application using JavaScript, Python, and SQL, based in part on the web trackâ€™s distribution code.

Ideas:

diarycards.db:
a log-in style website where users can track and update their progress in their dbt diary cards and dbt skills
users can log in and update their online diary card and daily dbt skills used which is stored in tables in the diarycards.db database
users will be able to track and save their progress through the dbt modules
dynamic tips will be provided depending on what the user is struggling with at any given time
?? maybe users will be able to customise their own diary cards? not sure if possible but I'll suss
